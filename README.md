## Library Used

- Flutter Bloc
- http
- dio
- Url launcher
- Shared Prefrences

## Flutter Bloc

Used to manage state in the app

## http and dio

used dio in my project for its advanced features, including response interceptors for logging and error handling

## Url launcher

used for launching URLs

## Shared Prefrences

Local Data Storage: used SharedPreferences to save data persistently on the user's device
Remind Later & Dismiss Functionality: In this project, I implemented functionality for “Remind Later” and “Dismiss” using SharedPreferences. The user’s choice (whether to remind later or dismiss a reminder) is stored locally, allowing the app to act accordingly on subsequent launches.
Storing Card Details: I stored card details using a card ID as the key and the associated card details as the value. The card ID is used to access a specific card's data from the stored map.
